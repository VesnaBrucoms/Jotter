# Current Use Cases

I currently make use of two note keeping apps: OneNote, and Google Keep.

### OneNote

Only accessed on desktop.

* Lecture notes - rapid typing, simple bullet points that are often nested
  * Each week of notes has a common structure that can be easily templated
* Reading notes - slower typing, more involved bullet points
  * Has a common structure that can easily be templated: citation, reading type, summary, usage, thoughts
  * Completed notes are copied over to relevant entry in Zotero
* Jotting project/reasearch ideas & thoughts
* Occaisionally including images alongside the text
* Organised across notebooks, and within many sections and section groups

Generally OneNote is longer form, and longer term notes. Noting down info that I want to refer back to over the course
of many months, if not longer. Often a common structure from session to session; a boilerplate that can be templated.

### Google Keep

Accessed frequently on desktop and mobile.

* Shopping checklists
  * Frequent deletion of ticked items
* Travel checklists
  * Frequent unticking of all ticked items
* Various life lists (e.g. gifts, reminders, etc)
* Keeping small bits of info (e.g. clothing sizings)

Generally usage of Keep is shorter and temporary, but portable. Used only for one errand or task, often on the go.
